# 👋 Hey, I’m HAMAXIT

I build **systems**, **games**, and **ideas that probably shouldn’t work — but do**.

I’m someone who likes breaking things down to first principles, then rebuilding them in weird but efficient ways. I'm intersted in:

- 🎮 Game Development  
- 🤖 AI & Experimental Architectures  
- 🖥️ Cross-platform application development

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🧩 CBM — Chunk-Based Model (AI Architecture)
A modular AI design where:
- Specialized **chunks** handle different domains (math, language, creativity, logic)
- An **Agent model** interprets input and activates the right chunks
- A **Compositor** merges outputs into a coherent response  

> Think: AI as a team of specialists instead of one overloaded brain.
